# Datathon Summer 2023 - Northeastern:

## Overview:
This repository serves as a foundational resource for the summer datathon. It includes essential notebooks that provide a starting point for data analysis and model development during the event. The baseline notebooks offers a structured framework, initial code templates to assist participants in getting started quickly and fostering collaboration. Participants can build upon these notebooks to develop innovative solutions and compete effectively in the datathon.

## Problem Statement:
A financial institution generally faces a critical situation with its least fulfilling assets. This has led to a significant decline in investor confidence, resulting in a significant drop in the institution's stock value in that particular quarter.

The primary cause of this decline is identified as loan defaulters who do not satisfy the loan completion. The bank recognizes the potential of machine learning to analyze its extensive and messy dataset, accumulated over the years, to identify defaulters and devise effective strategies to mitigate their impact. Knowing if someone is going to default is a trivial problem and can be solved by incorporating various machine-learning techniques. However, the most crucial part of this process is knowing how many credit lines a person owns which mostly correlates with the fact of them defaulting on any one of them.

Participants in this datathon are challenged to leverage data science and machine learning techniques to analyze the provided dataset, including customer information and loan details.

The objective of the datathon is to develop predictive models that accurately predict the total number of credit lines available in members' credit history. Participants must preprocess the data, engineer informative features, and apply suitable machine learning algorithms to build robust models. The solutions should consider various factors in the dataset which is explained in the Data tab.
